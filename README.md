**President/Founder/Lead Developer [@Posted-Communications](https://github.com/Posted-Communications), Software Consultant, Independent Developer**

**👋 Hi there!**<br>
I'm an independent front-end web developer who takes on projects that are way to ambitious for a single-developer!
I'm always up for a challenge, and if I start a project, I will complete at somepoint.
